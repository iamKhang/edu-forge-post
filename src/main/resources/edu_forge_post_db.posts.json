Why would anyone want to control how many instances a class has? The most common reason for this is to control access to some shared resource&mdash;for example, a database or a file.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works: imagine that you created an object, but after a while decided to create a new one. Instead of receiving a fresh object, you&rsquo;ll get the one you already created.</p>\n<p>Note that this behavior is impossible to implement with a regular constructor since a constructor call&nbsp;<strong>must</strong> always return a new object by design.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/singleton/singleton-comic-1-en.png\" alt=\"The global access to an object\"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Provide a global access point to that instance</strong>. Remember those global variables that you (all right, me) used to store some essential objects? While they&rsquo;re very handy, they&rsquo;re also very unsafe since any code can potentially overwrite the contents of those variables and crash the app.</p>\n<p>Just like a global variable, the Singleton pattern lets you access some object from anywhere in the program. However, it also protects that instance from being overwritten by other code.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s another side to this problem: you don&rsquo;t want the code that solves problem #1 to be scattered all over your program. It&rsquo;s much better to have it within one class, especially if the rest of your code already depends on it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nowadays, the Singleton pattern has become so popular that people may call something a&nbsp;<em>singleton</em>&nbsp;even if it solves just one of the listed problems.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section solution\">\n<h2 id=\"solution\">&nbsp;Solution</h2>\n<p>All implementations of the Singleton have these two steps in common:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make the default constructor private, to prevent other objects from using the&nbsp;<code>new</code>&nbsp;operator with the Singleton class.</li>\n<li>Create a static creation method that acts as a constructor. Under the hood, this method calls the private constructor to create an object and saves it in a static field. All following calls to this method return the cached object.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your code has access to the Singleton class, then it&rsquo;s able to call the Singleton&rsquo;s static method. So whenever that method is called, the same object is always returned.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section analogy\">\n<h2 id=\"analogy\">&nbsp;Real-World Analogy</h2>\n<p>The government is an excellent example of the Singleton pattern. A country can have only one official government. Regardless of the personal identities of the individuals who form governments, the title, &ldquo;The Government of X&rdquo;, is a global point of access that identifies the group of people in charge.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section structure-container\">\n<h2 id=\"structure\">&nbsp;Structure</h2>\n<div class=\"structure\">\n<div class=\"struct-image1 struct-image\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/singleton/structure-en-indexed.png\" alt=\"The structure of the Singleton pattern\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>",

The first version of your app can only handle transportation by trucks, so the bulk of your code lives inside the&nbsp;<code>Truck</code>&nbsp;class.</p>\n<p>After a while, your app becomes pretty popular. Each day you receive dozens of requests from sea transportation companies to incorporate sea logistics into the app.</p>\n<p><strong><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/factory-method/problem1-en.png\" alt=\"Adding a new transportation class to the program causes an issue\"></strong></p>\n<p>Great news, right? But how about the code? At present, most of your code is coupled to the <code>Truck</code>&nbsp;class. Adding&nbsp;<code>Ships</code>&nbsp;into the app would require making changes to the entire codebase. Moreover, if later you decide to add another type of transportation to the app, you will probably need to make all of these changes again.</p>\n<p>As a result, you will end up with pretty nasty code, riddled with conditionals that switch the app&rsquo;s behavior depending on the class of transportation objects.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section solution\">\n<h2 id=\"solution\">&nbsp;Solution</h2>\n<p>The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the&nbsp;<code>new</code>&nbsp;operator) with calls to a special&nbsp;<em>factory</em>&nbsp;method. Don&rsquo;t worry: the objects are still created via the&nbsp;<code>new</code>&nbsp;operator, but it&rsquo;s being called from within the factory method. Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as&nbsp;<em>products.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><img src=\"https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/factory-method/solution1.png\" alt=\"The structure of creator classes\"></em></p>\n<p>At first glance, this change may look pointless: we just moved the constructor call from one part of the program to another. However, consider this: now you can override the factory method in a subclass and change the class of products being created by the method.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a slight limitation though: subclasses may return different types of products only if these products have a common base class or interface. Also, the factory method in the base class should have its return type declared as this interface.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/factory-method/solution2-en.png\" alt=\"The structure of the products hierarchy\"></p>\n<p>For example, both&nbsp;<code>Truck</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>Ship</code>&nbsp;classes should implement the&nbsp;<code>Transport</code>&nbsp;interface, which declares a method called&nbsp;<code>deliver</code>. Each class implements this method differently: trucks deliver cargo by land, ships deliver cargo by sea. The factory method in the&nbsp;<code>RoadLogistics</code>&nbsp;class returns truck objects, whereas the factory method in the&nbsp;<code>SeaLogistics</code> class returns ships.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/factory-method/solution3-en.png\" alt=\"The structure of the code after applying the factory method pattern\"></p>\n<p>The code that uses the factory method (often called the&nbsp;<em>client</em>&nbsp;code) doesn&rsquo;t see a difference between the actual products returned by various subclasses. The client treats all the products as abstract&nbsp;<code>Transport</code>. The client knows that all transport objects are supposed to have the&nbsp;<code>deliver</code>&nbsp;method, but exactly how it works isn&rsquo;t important to the client.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section structure-container\">\n<h2 id=\"structure\">&nbsp;Structure</h2>\n<div class=\"structure\">\n<div class=\"struct-image1 struct-image\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/factory-method/structure-indexed.png\" alt=\"The structure of the Factory Method pattern\"></div>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"struct-li1\">\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Product</strong>&nbsp;declares the interface, which is common to all objects that can be produced by the creator and its subclasses.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"struct-li2\">\n<p><strong>Concrete Products</strong>&nbsp;are different implementations of the product interface.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"struct-li3\">\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Creator</strong>&nbsp;class declares the factory method that returns new product objects. It&rsquo;s important that the return type of this method matches the product interface.</p>\n<p>You can declare the factory method as&nbsp;<code>abstract</code>&nbsp;to force all subclasses to implement their own versions of the method. As an alternative, the base factory method can return some default product type.</p>\n<p>Note, despite its name, product creation is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;the primary responsibility of the creator. Usually, the creator class already has some core business logic related to products. The factory method helps to decouple this logic from the concrete product classes. Here is an analogy: a large software development company can have a training department for programmers. However, the primary function of the company as a whole is still writing code, not producing programmers.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"struct-li4\">\n<p><strong>Concrete Creators</strong>&nbsp;override the base factory method so it returns a different type of product.</p>\n<p>Note that the factory method doesn&rsquo;t have to&nbsp;<strong>create</strong>&nbsp;new instances all the time.

Under various operating systems, these elements may look a little bit different, but they should still behave consistently. A button in Windows is still a button in Linux.</p>\n<p>When the factory method comes into play, you don&rsquo;t need to rewrite the logic of the&nbsp;<code>Dialog</code>&nbsp;class for each operating system. If we declare a factory method that produces buttons inside the base&nbsp;<code>Dialog</code>&nbsp;class, we can later create a subclass that returns Windows-styled buttons from the factory method. The subclass then inherits most of the code from the base class, but, thanks to the factory method, can render Windows-looking buttons on the screen.</p>\n<p>For this pattern to work, the base&nbsp;<code>Dialog</code>&nbsp;class must work with abstract buttons: a base class or an interface that all concrete buttons follow. This way the code within&nbsp;<code>Dialog</code>&nbsp;remains functional, whichever type of buttons it works with.</p>\n<p>Of course, you can apply this approach to other UI elements as well. However, with each new factory method you add to the&nbsp;<code>Dialog</code>, you get closer to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory\">Abstract Factory</a> pattern.

Therefore it&rsquo;s easier to extend the product construction code independently from the rest of the code.</p>\n<p>For example, to add a new product type to the app, you&rsquo;ll only need to create a new creator subclass and override the factory method in it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"applicability-problem\">\n<p>&nbsp;Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"applicability-solution\">\n<p>&nbsp;Inheritance is probably the easiest way to extend the default behavior of a library or framework. But how would the framework recognize that your subclass should be used instead of a standard component?</p>\n<p>The solution is to reduce the code that constructs components across the framework into a single factory method and let anyone override this method in addition to extending the component itself.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see how that would work. Imagine that you write an app using an open source UI framework. Your app should have round buttons, but the framework only provides square ones. You extend the standard&nbsp;<code>Button</code>&nbsp;class with a glorious&nbsp;<code>RoundButton</code>&nbsp;subclass. But now you need to tell the main&nbsp;<code>UIFramework</code>&nbsp;class to use the new button subclass instead of a default one.</p>\n<p>To achieve this, you create a subclass&nbsp;<code>UIWithRoundButtons</code>&nbsp;from a base framework class and override its&nbsp;<code>createButton</code>&nbsp;method. While this method returns&nbsp;<code>Button</code>&nbsp;objects in the base class, you make your subclass return&nbsp;<code>RoundButton</code>&nbsp;objects. Now use the&nbsp;<code>UIWithRoundButtons</code>&nbsp;class instead of&nbsp;<code>UIFramework</code>. And that&rsquo;s about it!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"applicability-problem\">\n<p>&nbsp;Use the Factory Method when you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"applicability-solution\">\n<p>&nbsp;You often experience this need when dealing with large, resource-intensive objects such as database connections, file systems, and network resources.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s think about what has to be done to reuse an existing object:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, you need to create some storage to keep track of all of the created objects.</li>\n<li>When someone requests an object, the program should look for a free object inside that pool.</li>\n<li>&hellip; and then return it to the client code.</li>\n<li>If there are no free objects, the program should create a new one (and add it to the pool).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That&rsquo;s a lot of code! And it must all be put into a single place so that you don&rsquo;t pollute the program with duplicate code.</p>\n<p>Probably the most obvious and convenient place where this code could be placed is the constructor of the class whose objects we&rsquo;re trying to reuse. However, a constructor must always return&nbsp;<strong>new objects</strong>&nbsp;by definition. It can&rsquo;t return existing instances.</p>\n<p>Therefore, you need to have a regular method capable of creating new objects as well as reusing existing ones. That sounds very much like a factory method.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section checklist\">\n<h2 id=\"checklist\">&nbsp;How to Implement</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Make all products follow the same interface. This interface should declare methods that make sense in every product.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add an empty factory method inside the creator class. The return type of the method should match the common product interface.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the creator&rsquo;s code find all references to product constructors. One by one, replace them with calls to the factory method, while extracting the product creation code into the factory method.</p>\n<p>You might need to add a temporary parameter to the factory method to control the type of returned product.</p>\n<p>At this point, the code of the factory method may look pretty ugly. It may have a large&nbsp;<code>switch</code>&nbsp;statement that picks which product class to instantiate. But don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll fix it soon enough.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now, create a set of creator subclasses for each type of product listed in the factory method. Override the factory method in the subclasses and extract the appropriate bits of construction code from the base method.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If there are too many product types and it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to create subclasses for all of them, you can reuse the control parameter from the base class in subclasses.</p>\n<p>For instance, imagine that you have the following hierarchy of classes: the base&nbsp;<code>Mail</code>&nbsp;class with a couple of subclasses:&nbsp;<code>AirMail</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>GroundMail</code>; the&nbsp;<code>Transport</code>&nbsp;classes are&nbsp;<code>Plane</code>,&nbsp;<code>Truck</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>Train</code>. While the&nbsp;<code>AirMail</code>&nbsp;class only uses&nbsp;<code>Plane</code>&nbsp;objects,&nbsp;<code>GroundMail</code>&nbsp;may work with both&nbsp;<code>Truck</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>Train</code>&nbsp;objects. You can create a new subclass (say&nbsp;<code>TrainMail</code>) to handle both cases, but there&rsquo;s another option. The client code can pass an argument to the factory method of the&nbsp;<code>GroundMail</code>&nbsp;class to control which product it wants to receive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If, after all of the extractions, the base factory method has become empty, you can make it abstract. If there&rsquo;s something left, you can make it a default behavior of the method.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>",

Your code consists of classes that represent:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A family of related products, say:&nbsp;<code>Chair</code>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<code>Sofa</code>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<code>CoffeeTable</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Several variants of this family. For example, products&nbsp;<code>Chair</code>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<code>Sofa</code>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<code>CoffeeTable</code>&nbsp;are available in these variants:&nbsp;<code>Modern</code>,&nbsp;<code>Victorian</code>,&nbsp;<code>ArtDeco</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/abstract-factory/problem-en.png\" alt=\"Product families and their variants.\"></p>\n<p>You need a way to create individual furniture objects so that they match other objects of the same family.

Furniture vendors update their catalogs very often, and you wouldn&rsquo;t want to change the core code each time it happens.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section solution\">\n<h2 id=\"solution\">&nbsp;Solution</h2>\n<p>The first thing the Abstract Factory pattern suggests is to explicitly declare interfaces for each distinct product of the product family (e.g., chair, sofa or coffee table). Then you can make all variants of products follow those interfaces. For example, all chair variants can implement the&nbsp;<code>Chair</code>&nbsp;interface; all coffee table variants can implement the&nbsp;<code>CoffeeTable</code> interface, and so on.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/abstract-factory/solution1.png\" alt=\"The Chairs class hierarchy\"></p>\n<p>The next move is to declare the&nbsp;<em>Abstract Factory</em>&mdash;an interface with a list of creation methods for all products that are part of the product family (for example,&nbsp;<code>createChair</code>,&nbsp;<code>createSofa</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>createCoffeeTable</code>). These methods must return&nbsp;<strong>abstract</strong>&nbsp;product types represented by the interfaces we extracted previously:&nbsp;<code>Chair</code>,&nbsp;<code>Sofa</code>,&nbsp;<code>CoffeeTable</code> and so on.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/abstract-factory/solution2.png\" alt=\"The _Factories_ class hierarchy\"></p>\n<p>Now, how about the product variants? For each variant of a product family, we create a separate factory class based on the&nbsp;<code>AbstractFactory</code>&nbsp;interface. A factory is a class that returns products of a particular kind. For example, the&nbsp;<code>ModernFurnitureFactory</code>&nbsp;can only create&nbsp;<code>ModernChair</code>,&nbsp;<code>ModernSofa</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>ModernCoffeeTable</code>&nbsp;objects.</p>\n<p>The client code has to work with both factories and products via their respective abstract interfaces. This lets you change the type of a factory that you pass to the client code, as well as the product variant that the client code receives, without breaking the actual client code.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/content/abstract-factory/abstract-factory-comic-2-en.png\"></p>\n<p>Say the client wants a factory to produce a chair. The client doesn&rsquo;t have to be aware of the factory&rsquo;s class, nor does it matter what kind of chair it gets. Whether it&rsquo;s a Modern model or a Victorian-style chair, the client must treat all chairs in the same manner, using the abstract&nbsp;<code>Chair</code>&nbsp;interface. With this approach, the only thing that the client knows about the chair is that it implements the&nbsp;<code>sitOn</code>&nbsp;method in some way. Also, whichever variant of the chair is returned, it&rsquo;ll always match the type of sofa or coffee table produced by the same factory object.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s one more thing left to clarify: if the client is only exposed to the abstract interfaces, what creates the actual factory objects? Usually, the application creates a concrete factory object at the initialization stage. Just before that, the app must select the factory type depending on the configuration or the environment settings.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section structure-container\">\n<h2 id=\"structure\">&nbsp;Structure</h2>\n<div class=\"structure\">\n<div class=\"struct-image1 struct-image\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://refactoring.guru/images/patterns/diagrams/abstract-factory/structure-indexed.png\" alt=\"Abstract Factory design pattern\"></div>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"struct-li1\">\n<p><strong>Abstract Products</strong>&nbsp;declare interfaces for a set of distinct but related products which make up a product family.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"struct-li2\">\n<p><strong>Concrete Products</strong>&nbsp;are various implementations of abstract products, grouped by variants.

This way the client code that uses a factory doesn&rsquo;t get coupled to the specific variant of the product it gets from a factory.

Moreover, it&rsquo;s your job to make sure that the UI elements match the style of the current operating system. You wouldn&rsquo;t want your program to render macOS controls when it&rsquo;s executed in Windows.</p>\n<p>The Abstract Factory interface declares a set of creation methods that the client code can use to produce different types of UI elements. Concrete factories correspond to specific operating systems and create the UI elements that match that particular OS.</p>\n<p>It works like this: when an application launches, it checks the type of the current operating system. The app uses this information to create a factory object from a class that matches the operating system. The rest of the code uses this factory to create UI elements. This prevents the wrong elements from being created.</p>\n<p>With this approach, the client code doesn&rsquo;t depend on concrete classes of factories and UI elements as long as it works with these objects via their abstract interfaces. This also lets the client code support other factories or UI elements that you might add in the future.</p>\n<p>As a result, you don&rsquo;t need to modify the client code each time you add a new variation of UI elements to your app. You just have to create a new factory class that produces these elements and slightly modify the app&rsquo;s initialization code so it selects that class when appropriate.</p>\n<figure class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"code cm-s-default CodeMirror\" lang=\"pseudocode\"><span class=\"cm-doc\">// The abstract factory interface declares a set of methods that</span>\n<span class=\"cm-doc\">// return different abstract products.
